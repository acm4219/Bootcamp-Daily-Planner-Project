# Daily Planner Project
### Description
This application is a daily planner where you can save your daily plans and clear out the old ones. 
### Live Site
[Bootcamp Homework Four](https://acm4219.github.io/Bootcamp-Daily-Planner-Project/02-Homework/Develop)
### Usage
You use the application by entering in your plans for the day in the allotted slot of time and hit the save button to save it. It remains on the page until you clear the local storage and refresh for new slots to fill for your day. Originally it was going to have a timed system attached to it but unfortunately I wasn't able to get it working.

### Challenges
I was not able to figure out how to change the CSS for the submission rows based in moment.js. I feel that I got really close but will have to come back to it when I have more time to comprehend the material. 

### Credits
I was able to create what I did from working with our instructor at the bootcamp as well as some online resources like Stack Overflow to put together what I currently have submitted.
